## User Stories:

1. As a user with specific media interests, I want to find cross-media recommendations based on my favourite titles so that I can discover new content I'll likely enjoy.

2. As an undecided user, I want to receive diverse recommendations based on my past likes so that I can discover new interests I might not have considered.

3. As a curious user, I want to see why certain items were recommended to me so that I understand the connection between my preferences and suggestions.

4. As a developer myself, I want to be able to engage with upcoming versions and experimental editions of the site.
