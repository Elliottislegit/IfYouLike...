## User Stories:

1. As a user with specific media interests, I want to find cross-media recommendations based on my favorite titles so that I can discover new content I'll likely enjoy.

2. As a fan of specific genres, I want to find media from different categories (books, games, music) within that genre so that I can immerse myself completely in my preferred themes.

3. As an undecided user, I want to receive diverse recommendations based on my past likes so that I can discover new interests I might not have considered.

4. As a user with limited time, I want to filter recommendations by media type so that I only see content types I'm currently interested in exploring.

5. As a returning user, I want the system to remember my preferences so that I can get improved recommendations over time.

6. As a curious user, I want to see why certain items were recommended to me so that I understand the connection between my preferences and suggestions.

7. As a music enthusiast, I want to sample recommended music directly within the application so that I can quickly decide if I like it.
